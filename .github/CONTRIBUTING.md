# 🤝 Contributing to Hill Boost Ensemble

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

We’re building a GPU-powered, hill climbing–optimized ensemble learning system — and we’d love your help.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rwtarpit/HillBoost-Ensemble.git
   cd HillBoost-Ensemble
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** — whether it’s improving the ensemble, adding a new model, or refactoring code

5. **Commit and push your changes**:
6.   ```bash
     git add .
      git commit -m "Add feature: your feature name"
      git push origin feature/your-feature-name
 
7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub from your branch into main
Add a description of what your change does and link any relevant issue
8. **Guidelines**:
      1.Keep your code modular — prefer reusable functions inside the src/ folder

      2.Use meaningful variable names and add docstrings to new functions
      
      3.If you’re working in notebooks, keep them clean: no leftover test cells, huge outputs, or redundant prints
      
      4.Use GPU-accelerated libraries only (e.g., RAPIDS, CuPy)
      
      5.Format your code with black or autopep8 if you're writing .py files
      
      6.f you're contributing a new model, mention:
      
      The library it uses 
      Its GPU support
      Any special data preprocessing it needs

9. **Good First Issues**:
    If you're looking for somewhere to get started, here are some beginner-friendly ideas:

    1.🔌 Add support for more GPU-based models from RAPIDS (like cuML)
   
    2. 🚀Add logic for training each model individually on different aspects of dataset for more model versatality
   
    3.🧪 Add a synthetic dataset and a small test suite in /tests
   
    4.📈 Add visuals for better model inference
   
    5.🛠️ Build a command-line interface (CLI) to run ensembles easily
   
    6.💾 Create a config.json support system for model settings
